# ALX Project Nexus: A ProDev Backend Engineering Journey

Welcome to my ALX Project Nexus Documentation repository. This project serves as a comprehensive
documentation hub, chronicling my journey and key learnings throughout the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering
program. It showcases my understanding of modern backend concepts, tools, and the best practices I've adopted.

## Overview of the ProDev Backend Engineering Program

This repository serves as a knowledge hub and capstone project documentation for the **ALX ProDev
Backend Engineering** program. It consolidates key learnings, challenges, and best practices acquired
throughout the program, culminating in the development of a fully functional **E-Commerce Backend API**
as a required for **Project Nexus**.

---

## Features

- **Modern Backend Stack**: Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Celery, Redis
- **RESTful & GraphQL APIs**: Flexible API consumption options
- **Containerized**: Ready for Docker deployment
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Architecture, API references, and guides
